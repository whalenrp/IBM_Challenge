Classify Output File outputFile.txt
Human Readble trees are printed as follows:
  Node#: True_Probability Column_Identifier Split_Value

  Node# represents the Breadth-First-Search number of this node
  True_Probability is the likelihood that a piece of data with this
    classification is true
  Column_Identifier is the human-readable header for the column this node
    will split over
  Split_Value is the value used for splitting. All entries with value
    < Split_Value will be classified to the left child.
